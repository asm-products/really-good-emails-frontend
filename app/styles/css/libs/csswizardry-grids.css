/**
 * csswizardry grids provides you with widths to suit a number of breakpoints
 * designed around devices of a size you specify. Out of the box, csswizardry
 * grids caters to the following types of device:
 *
 * palm     --  palm-based devices, like phones and small tablets
 * lap      --  lap-based devices, like iPads or laptops
 * portable --  all of the above
 * desk     --  stationary devices, like desktop computers
 * regular  --  any/all types of device
 *
 * These namespaces are then used in the library to give you the ability to
 * manipulate your layouts based around them, for example:
 *
   <div class="grid__item  one-whole  lap--one-half  desk--one-third">
 *
 * This would give you a grid item which is 100% width unless it is on a lap
 * device, at which point it become 50% wide, or it is on a desktop device, at
 * which point it becomes 33.333% width.
 *
 * csswizardry grids also has push and pull classes which allow you to nudge
 * grid items left and right by a defined amount. These follow the same naming
 * convention as above, but are prepended by either `push--` or `pull--`, for
 * example:
 *
   `class="grid__item  one-half  push--one-half"`
 *
 * This would give you a grid item which is 50% width and pushed over to the
 * right by 50%.
 *
 * All classes in csswizardry grids follow this patten, so you should fairly
 * quickly be able to piece together any combinations you can imagine, for
 * example:
 *
   `class="grid__item  one-whole  lap--one-half  desk--one-third  push--desk--one-third"`
 *
   `class="grid__item  one-quarter  palm--one-half  push--palm--one-half"`
 *
   `class="grid__item  palm--one-third  desk--five-twelfths"`

    $VARIABLES
\*------------------------------------*/
/**
 * If you are building a non-responsive site but would still like to use
 * csswizardry-grids, set this to ‘false’:
 */
/**
 * Is this build mobile first? Setting to ‘true’ means that all grids will be
 * 100% width if you do not apply a more specific class to them.
 */
/**
 * Set the spacing between your grid items.
 */
/**
 * Would you like Sass’ silent classes, or regular CSS classes?
 */
/**
 * Would you like push and pull classes enabled?
 */
/**
 * Using `inline-block` means that the grid items need their whitespace removing
 * in order for them to work correctly. Set the following to true if you are
 * going to achieve this by manually removing/commenting out any whitespace in
 * your HTML yourself.
 *
 * Setting this to false invokes a hack which cannot always be guaranteed,
 * please see the following for more detail:

 */
/**
 * Define your breakpoints. The first value is the prefix that shall be used for
 * your classes (e.g. `.palm--one-half`), the second value is the media query
 * that the breakpoint fires at.
 */
/**
 * Define which namespaced breakpoints you would like to generate for each of
 * widths, push and pull. This is handy if you only need pull on, say, desk, or
 * you only need a new width breakpoint at mobile sizes. It allows you to only
 * compile as much CSS as you need. All are turned on by default, but you can
 * add and remove breakpoints at will.
 *
 * Push and pull shall only be used if `$push` and/or `$pull` and `$responsive`
 * have been set to ‘true’.

    $MIXINS
\*------------------------------------*/
/**
 * These mixins are for the library to use only, you should not need to modify
 * them at all.
 *
 * Enclose a block of code with a media query as named in `$breakpoints`.
 */
/**
 * Drop relative positioning into silent classes which can’t take advantage of
 * the `[class*="push--"]` and `[class*="pull--"]` selectors.

    $GRID SETUP
\*------------------------------------*/
/**
 * 1. Allow the grid system to be used on lists.
 * 2. Remove any margins and paddings that might affect the grid system.
 * 3. Apply a negative `margin-left` to negate the columns’ gutters.
 */
/**
 * 1. Cause columns to stack side-by-side.
 * 2. Space columns apart.
 * 3. Align columns to the tops of each other.
 * 4. Full-width unless told to behave otherwise.
 * 5. Required to combine fluid widths and fixed gutters.
 */
/**
 * Reversed grids allow you to structure your source in the opposite order to
 * how your rendered layout will appear. Extends `.grid`.
 */
/**
 * Gutterless grids have all the properties of regular grids, minus any spacing.
 * Extends `.grid`.
 */
/**
 * Align the entire grid to the right. Extends `.grid`.
 */
/**
 * Centered grids align grid items centrally without needing to use push or pull
 * classes. Extends `.grid`.
 */
/**
 * Align grid cells vertically (`.grid--middle` or `.grid--bottom`). Extends
 * `.grid`.
 */
/**
 * Create grids with narrower gutters. Extends `.grid`.
 */
/**
 * Create grids with wider gutters. Extends `.grid`.
